# Udacity-Med_Appointment-data-analysis

## Data Overview
This dataset contains information on over a hundred thousand medical appointments in Brazil, and focuses mainly on the question whether or not patients show up for their appointments. For each row, there is information on a number of characteristics of the patient such as the patient's id, gender, age, appointment date,Â and so on.


### Questions for Analysis
* How often did people miss appointments?

* Does the gender of the patient has a relation with the absence?

* Does the age of the patient have a relation with the absence?

* Did patients miss appointments because of not receiving a message??

* Does the scholarship affect the patient's attendance?


## Conclusions
From the dataset analyzed, it is observed that 79.81% (almost 80%) of the patients made it for their appointments while 20.19% of patients missed their appointments.
Gender-wise, it can be seen that the percentage of females that missed appointments are more than the percentage of males when they where look at seperately.It's important to note that the population of male patients where less than female patients and for that fact figures of the percentage may have changed if males where as many as females.
Also, it is seen that there is a difference between the percentage of no shows within different age groups. The old seem to miss the least while teens miss the most.Though may not be the cause, it is possible the old miss appointment least because people turn to be more conscious of their age when they get older.
In addition, certain days of the week was seen to have higher percentages of no shows. Saturday for instance had the least number of appointments but the most percentage of no shows.
However, the relationship between SMS received and No Shows was contrary to what was expected as patients who received SMS had more percentage of no shows.
Lastly, it is observed that patients with scholarship seem to miss their appointments more than those without scholarships.


### Limitation
One limitation of this analysis was the lack of some background information for the patients. In the analysis of the data, it was found that about 32% of the appointments had SMS messages received. It is possible that those patients were more likely to be encouraged to enroll in SMS notifications after they had already missed an appointment. That would mean that those who were receiving SMS where already having problems making it for appointments.
Also,though there is some data on the condition of some patients, there is not data on the kind of health reason for each the appointment since some health reasons are more life treating than others.
